            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Elon Musk, a visionary entrepreneur and engineer, has captivated the world with his bold ambitions and innovative spirit. Born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk showed early signs of brilliance and a relentless drive for exploration. He co-founded Zip2, an online city guide software company, which was sold in 1999, marking the beginning of his entrepreneurial journey. Musk then ventured into the financial sector with X.com, which later became PayPal, revolutionizing online payments.<br>

                Musk’s ambition and creativity are perhaps best exemplified by his founding roles in Tesla, Inc., SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company. Each of these ventures aims to push the boundaries of technology and human capability. His vision for sustainable energy through electric vehicles and solar energy, coupled with his goal of making humanity multi-planetary through SpaceX, has earned him a place among the most influential figures of the 21st century.</p>
